description: 'Mango is an exotic shorthair, adopted by Jess only a couple months ago. She is 8 years old and recently had to have all of her teeth removed, but don"t worry! Mango is absolutely thriving and happy. Mango is a brachycephalic cat, or to put it in simpler terms, flat faced! Flat-faced cats became popular in the 1950s after a kitten was born with a genetic mutation'
