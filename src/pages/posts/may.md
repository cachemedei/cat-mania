description: When I finished high school I made the adventurous decision to take up singing lessons to try something new. My singing teacher had 2 burmese kittens and I was shocked to find out that there are hypoallergenic breeds of cat. You see, I am allergic to cats! I had always loved them but made sure to keep my distance. Once I discovered this breed, I had to get one. Enter May. May was born with the soul of an old lady and resting grump face! To those that aren't familiar with her sweet nature, they just assume she's the crankiest lady in the world. At a young age, due to her breed and certain genetic factors, May had to have all of her teeth removed. This definitely didn't help the 'old lady' vibe. At 11 years old her favourite pass time is finding the perfect patch of sunshine to snooze in and when she's feeling bored, May will cheekily chase Nina around the house`
