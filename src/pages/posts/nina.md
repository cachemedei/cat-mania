description: 'I adopted Nina as kitten from Cat Haven during the height of COVID. Her boisterous personality helped bring some life and fun back into the house. She is now nearly 5 years old! But like a lot of animals that joined families during COVID, Nina spent her first year of life with me always around the house. She finds ways to entertain herself while I am out and about but is definitely a much happier girl when mum is home to hang out with'
